# Jobs_API Script

## **Description**
The **Jobs_API** script is designed to launch a locally hosted website that displays JSON data in a table format. This provides an easy way to visualize and interact with the data.

## **Issue Encountered**
The script did not work as expected for me. The process of launching the locally hosted website was unsuccessful.

## **Workaround**
Instead of using the script, I opted to:
1. Download the JSON file directly to my local machine.
2. Access and manipulate the data locally without relying on the hosted website.
