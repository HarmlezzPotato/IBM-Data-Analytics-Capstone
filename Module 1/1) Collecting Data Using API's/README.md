<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>
  The <strong>Jobs_API</strong> script is designed to launch a locally hosted website that displays JSON data in a table format for easy visualization.
</p>

<h2><strong>Issue Encountered</strong></h2>
<p>
  The script did not work for me. The process of launching the locally hosted website was unsuccessful.
</p>

<h2><strong>Workaround</strong></h2>
<p>
  Instead of using the script, I opted to:
  <ul>
    <li>Download the JSON file directly to my local machine.</li>
    <li>Access and analyze the data manually without the hosted table view.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
